    "## Overview\n",
    "### System Layout and Overall Goal\n",
    "The overall system dimensions of an activated carbon adsorbent cassette are shown in the image below, and the aim is to select a shape that best intensifies a TSA operation, so waste energy can drive adsorbent regeneration and change the economic of critical gas spearation functions. Ideally, this single TSA process could be used for each of the critical gas separation functions, listed in the table below, [(CO2 Source)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c01618), just with different configurations. The missing detail is the knowledge of how \"the best\" shape may vary, as the function varies, as the Shape-Function-Performance connection is not well understood.\n",

    "![Adsorbent Layer](./images/intensify/adsorbent_layer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that the adsorbent layer has thin copper layers (orange), $ 200 \\mu m $, at the top and bottom (not visible) over which hot or cold water can flow. Internally, the adsorbent shape (dark grey) is undefined, and the Overall Goal for any Shape Candidate is to produce the most adsorbate volume (e.g. $CO_2/CH_4$) per unit-volume of Adsorber System, using the least paid-for energy possible, and there may be a different \"best\" shape for for each gas separation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the system uses the existing pressure drop in the flow stream, which we assume is $\\Delta P= 20 \\frac{ kPa}{m^{2}}$), and the temperature swing is driven by a nearby waste energy source (i.e $T_{a} = 300 K, T_{d} = 368 K$), then the paid-for-energy amounts to pumping energy to circulate the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mulitple, Critical Trade-Offs for every Shape Candidate\n",
    "As a consequence of using waste energy for regeneration, re-use of embodied energy  is favoured, so the energy in the stream itself is used to drive flow through the adsorbent. This Pressure Drop goal is seen as manadatory for the intensification of a TSA using waste energy, so all Shape Candidates must meet a Pressure Drop of $\\Delta P = 20 \\frac{kPa}{m*{2}} $). Then for each Candidate Shape, the Primary Goal is to produce the greatest adsorbate volume per unit time for a particular TSA Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there may be multiple Shape Candidates that produce within a few percent of the maximum adsorbate volume (i.e. a Pareto Front), and in that case the selection is based on how each Shape Canbdidate within the Front, achieves various Secondary or Tertiary Goals, that can be used to rank the function performance of any Shape Candidate at a specific TSA Function Point:\n",
    "1. Volume Adsorbed per Cycle vs Layer Volume -> Ideally, $Volume_{ads} = Volume_{layer} - Voidage$\n",
    "2. Time to Swing vs Time to Adsorb -> Ideally, $ Time_{swing} < 10% * Time_{ads}$\n",
    "3. Quality Returned, Chromotographic Graph vs Square Graph -> Ideally $Wave_{Front} = $Wave_{Square}$\n",
    "4. Cost, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that each Shape Candidate is likely to have a unique set of performance metrics across these sub goals. Thereby there is likely to be a Pareto Front of Shape Candidates that produce adsorbate volume within a few percent of the maximum adsorbate volume, and that selection between this reduced set of Shape Candidates requires consideration of these other factors. This study aims to develop a rational framework for trade-off analysis for the purposes of process intensification.\n",

    "### 4 Shape Families, 4 Shape Candidates from Each\n",
    "This initial examination is over four simple shape families that can be defined analytically and embodied using a conventional paramteric 3d shape modeller used by Ansys or Comsol. More complex shapes (e.g. multi-scale, artery, weaves, custom patterns etc.), require algorithmic modelling, will be pursued if this initial simple study is useful. The aim is to use 4 variations of each Shape Family that each meet $\\Delta P_D$ hard limit, in total 6 Shape Candidates:\n",
    "1. Spheres: [Tetrahedral Lattice, Cubic Lattice, Random Packed and Close Packed (FCC)](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpherePacking.html), based on the Ergun equation where each  Packing Type has a different characteristic porosity, and characteristic sphere radius (i.e. four radii).\n",
    "2. Monolith: Few Big Tubes vs Many Small Tubes. The rectangular monolith face model is based on replicated square unit cells, each with a longitudinal tube through the adsorbent. The study will choose the number, layout and size of tubes in the face model, so they both satisfy the pressure drop and irrigate a tube-wall adsorbent thickness equal to each of the four sphere radii (i.e. similar adosrption and desorption times)\n",
    "3. Vertical Laminates: Thick Laminates vs Thin Laminates. The vertical laminates consists of four thicknesses equivalent to the diameters of the spheres, with spacing to meet the pressure drop constraint.\n",
    "4. Fibre Square Lattice: Thick fibres vs thin Fibres. Sqaure lattice from tubes with diamters, equivalent to the four spheres, with spacing to meet the pressure drop constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Shape Family is represented by four Shape Candidates with diverse adsorbent thickness dimensions, and a wide range of porosities, which all meet the pressure drop constraint. Across all Shape Family's there are four common adsorption thicknesses, so each layout family has a geometry instance for a common adsorption time. In short, by using this approach, there is a means of comparing the performance of each Shape Family's effectiveness at an equivalent adsorption time basis, over four very different adosption times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Adsorbent Material, Across a Range of Concentrations\n",
    "All Shapes Candidates are assumed to be constructed with the same Activated Carbon material, in this case Maxsorb, except for the Fibre Lattice, which has Maxsorb properties, except it assumes the thermal conductivity of carbon fibre. This means the focus is solely on Shape Family performance, and how it may vary with concentration (i.e. application). The single variation in materials is carbon fibres, where Maxsorb adosrption properties could be assumed, but with carbon fibre thermal conductivity. However, this material is not in the current study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplest Possible Analysis is Applied to Create the 16 Shape Candidates\n",
    "We will use analytical relations to define the shapes based on pressure drop.\n"
