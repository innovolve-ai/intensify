    "## Overview\n",
    "### System Layout and Overall Goal\n",
    "The overall system dimensions of an activated carbon adsorbent layer are shown in the image below, and the aim is to choose a shape that intensifies the TSA operation, when the Pressure Drop $\\Delta P_D = 20 \\frac{kPa}{m*{2}} $. This Notebook examines 6 simple shape archetypes, as a preliminary to a more advanced study.\n",

    "![Adsorbent Layer](./images/intensify/adsorbent_layer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that the adsorbent layer has thin copper layers (orange), $ 200 \\mu m $, over which hot or cold water can flow. Internally, the adsorbent shape (dark grey) is undefined, and the goal is to produce the most adsorbate volume (e.g. CO2 or CH4) per unit-volume of Adsorber System, using the least paid-for energy possible. Assuming the system uses the existing pressure drop in the flow stream (i.e. $20 \\frac{20 kPa}{m^{2}}$), and the temperature swing is driven by waste energy (i.e $T_{a} = 300 K, T_{d} = 368 K$), then the paid-for-energy amounts to pumping energy to circulate the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Trade-Offs for each Shape Instance\n",
    "But the adsorbate volume goal is comprised of trade-offs between multiple sub-goals, starting with 3 orthognal decisions:\n",
    "1. Volume Adsorbed per Cycle vs Layer Volume\n",
    "2. Time to Adsorb vs Time to Swing\n",
    "3. Quality Returned, Chromotographic Graph vs Square Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that each Shape Candidate is likely to have a unique series of performance metrics across these 3 sub goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 Shape Families, 2 Shape Candidates from Each\n",
    "The initial examination is over 3 shape families that can be analysed analytically, with two variations on each that meet $\\Delta P_D$ hard limit, in total 6 Shape Candidates:\n",
    "1. Spheres: Close-Packed vs Square-Packed\n",
    "2. Monolith: Few Big Tubes vs Many Small Tubes \n",
    "3. Laminates: Thick Laminates vs Thin Laminates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Adsorbent Material, Across a Range of Concentrations\n",
    "All Shapes are constructed with the same Activated Carbon material, in this case Maxsorb, so the focus can be solely on shape performance, and how it may vary with concentration (i.e. application). \n",
    "\n",
    "The adsorption performance of each Shape Candidate will then be examined across a range of adsorbate concentrations listed in the table below, [(CO2 Source)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c01618).\n",
    "\n",
    "Type | CH4 Molar Fraction | Partial Pressure (kPa)\n",
    ":-----------|:------------:|------------:\n",
    "Water-Gas Shift Concentration | $$\\gamma_H = 60\\% $$ | $$p_{A_H} = P_{sys} \\cdot  \\gamma_H = 1.336 kPa$$\n",
    "Post-combustion Pulvarised Coal Concentration | $$\\gamma_M = 15\\%$$ | $$p_{A_H} = P_{sys} \\cdot  \\gamma_H = 0.89 kPa$$\n",
    "Post-combustion Gas Concentration | $$\\gamma_M = 4\\%$$ | $$p_{A_H} = P_{sys} \\cdot  \\gamma_H = 0.89 kPa$$\n",
    "VAM High Concentration | $$\\gamma_P = 0.5\\%$$ | $$p_{A_H} = P_{sys} \\cdot  \\gamma_H = 0.557 kPa$$\n",
    "VAM Low Concentration | $$\\gamma_T = 0.2\\%$$ | $$p_{A_H} = P_{sys} \\cdot  \\gamma_H = 0.223 kPa$$\n",
    "Direct Air Capture (DAC) Concentration | $$\\gamma_{CO_2} = \\frac{400}{1,000,000}$$ | $$p_{A_H} = P_{sys} \\cdot  \\gamma_H = 0.045 kPa$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplest Possible Analysis is Applied\n",
    "We will use analytical relations to define the shapes based on pressure drop. The thermal and adsorption performance of each Shape Candidate is modelled using simple 1D/2-D difference calculations,across each of the concentrations. The results are then compared.\n",
