    "What is the best shape for micro-scale convective flows of gas, and how should these shapes be packed together into a porous structure to optimise adsorptive processes, or indeed other processes (e.g. catalytic)?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question, or variants of it have been investigated from many different perspectives for more than 300 years. Is there anything new that can be said, or shown?\n",
    "\n",
    "With the design requirements for the overall system established in the previous section, attention naturally turns to the design of the porous structure, and there are many competing paradigms for layout:\n",
    " - Common Porous Materials: Randomly packed beds of spheres, thin laminates stacked together, monoliths, foam etc.\n",
    " - Microchannels: Tiny channels in plates of different dimensions (nm to cm), which may include porous material\n",
    " - Biological Designs: Branching networks of smaller and smaller tubes in an artery/vein or ladder layout\n",
    " - Other Shape Designs: Tubes, straws, trusses, triply periodic minimal surfaces etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "No previous study has ever meaningfully compared these competing approaches for heterogenous gas-solid porous structures. Any new investigation would need some approach to unifying these diverse layout paradigms, and a method to comparing them in depth, across extensive variations. But where to start?\n",
    "\n",
    "Disruption can be developed by finding unrealised opportunity spaces within the assumptions that are commonly adopted, and so a careful review of the most effective methods of modelling porous structures, and their underpinning assumptions is conducted first. These models are then examined to consider whether they may be used to sensibly define a minimum dimension for the porous structure, based on some functional rationale (i.e. obeys some functional goal).\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the approach one takes to defining the smallest scale, constrains the possible shapes and packing layout that can be used. The set of all possible shapes is infinite, and to meaningfully compare them they need to be bounded by rationale into a reduced and more tractable set. \n",
    "\n",
    "This in fact, was the goal of the giants of the field of fluid flow and permeability of porous structures who, collectively over the last three hundred years, have refined the modelling to the point where almost any natural or man-made porous structure can be effectively explained by a relatively small set of simple assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the proven efficacy of these models in explaining empirical results for existing porous structure, does not translate into utility or usefulness for the convective flow designer trying to design the best porous structure for a given duty. In short, the current models are ideally suited to explaining existing structures through averaging and fitting, but contain assumptions that average away opportunities for optimisation at the micro-scale, and are inneffectual at designing optimal flow structures (i.e. the reverse job to explaining existing structures).\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop significantly more effective porous structures, the convective flow designer needs a completely different approach, one linked to functional outcomes at every scale. Further, a new model of shape is required that integrates all previous shapes, and is integrated with functional scales, so alternatives can be compared and contrasted properly. Finally, an in-depth experimental campaign is required to probe below the current assumptions on micro-flow, and realistically many thousands of discrete variations are required to credibly find insights beyond those of previous workers (typically limited to tens of variations).\n",

    "\n",
    "The study of fluid flow is broadly concerned with momentum transport based on a balance of forces. Pressure provides the driving force for momentum transport, while resistances are provided by fluid layers sliding over each other and the friction of walls encountered in the direction of flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main approaches have been used to model fluid flow through porous structures with complicated internal geometry's, in one method the structure is visualised as a bundle of tangled tubes with weird cross sections, in the other the structure is regarded as a collection of submerged objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of these two approaches are reviewed below with a focus on distinguishing the individual forces at work, and the assumptions underlying the models. The first set of forces to review are those within the fluid.\n",

    "#### Flow Scheme\n",
    "Consider a very general flow pattern, in which the fluid velocity may be in various directions at various places and may depend on the time $t$. The velocity components are then given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_x = v_x(x, y, z, t);    v_y = v_y(x, y, z, t);     v_z = v_z(x, y, z, t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation is shown in Fig. 2.1 below, with a small cube-shaped volume element within the flow field, each face having a unit area. The centre of the volume element is at the position $x, y, z$. At any instant in time, the volume element can be sliced in such a way as to remove half of the fluid within it, by cutting it perpendicular to the three directions in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the concern is to establish what force needs to be applied on the free (shaded) surface to replace the force exerted by the removed fluid. There will be two contributions to the force: that associated with pressure, and that associated with viscous forces.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Forces\n",
    "The pressure force will always be perpendicular to the exposed surface. Hence in (a), the force per unit area will be a vector $p \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_x$, that is the pressure, which is a scalar, is multiplied by the unit vector $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_x$, in the x-direction. Similarly, the force on the shaded area in (b) will be $p \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_y$, and in (c) the force will be $p \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_z$. The pressure forces will be exerted when the fluid is stationary as well as when it is in motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The viscous forces come into play only when there are velocity gradients within the fluid. In general, they are neither perpendicular or parallel to the surface element, but rather at some angle to the surface. In (a) the viscous force per unit area $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_x$ is exerted on the shaded area, and in (b) and (c), the forces per unit area are $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_y$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these vector forces have components (scalars), for example $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_x$ has components $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{xx}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{xy}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{xz}$. Table 2.1 below summarises the forces per unit area (stresses) acting on the 3 shaded areas, both by the thermodynamic pressure and the viscous stresses.

    "#### Simplifications\n",
    "The question now is: How are these stresses $\\tau_{ij}$ related to the velocity gradients in the fluid?\n",
    " * The viscous stress may be linear combinations of all of the velocity gradients: $$\\tau_{ij} = -\\sum_k \\sum_l \\mu_{ijkl} \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial x_l} \\text{  where } i, j, k, \\text{ and } l \\text{ may be} 1, 2, 3 $$ Here the 81 quantities $\\mu_{ijkl}$ are \"viscosity coefficients\". The quantities are $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and $v_1. v_2, v_3$ are the same as $v_x, v_y, v_z$    \n",
    " * Time derivatives or time integrals should not appear in the expression, unless the fluid is visco-elastic (non-Newtonian)\n",
    " * Viscous forces should not be present if the fluid is in a state of pure rotation. This requirement leads to the necessity that $\\tau_{ij}$ be a symmetric combination of the velocity gradients (i.e. if i and j are interchanged, the velocity gradients remain unchanged). It can be shown that the only symmetric linear combinations of velocity gradients are $$\\left (\\frac{\\partial v_j}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j} \\right ) \\text{  and  }  \\left(\\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} \\right) \\delta_{ij} $$\n",
    " * If the fluid is isotropic - that is it has no preferred direction - then the coefficients in front of the two expressions in Eqn. (4) must be scalars, so that $$\\tau_{ij} = A\\left (\\frac{\\partial v_j}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j} \\right ) +  B\\left(\\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} \\right) \\delta_{ij}$$ This reduces the number of viscosity coefficients from 81 to 2.\n",
    " * For one-dimensional flow, Eqn (5) will reduce to $\\tau_{yx} = A dv_x/dy$ and hence the scalar constant $A$ must be the negative of the viscosity $\\mu$\n",
    " * Finally, by common agreement, the scalar constant $B$ is set equal to $\\frac{2}{3} \\mu - \\kappa$,  where $\\kappa$ is called the _dilational viscosity_. From kinetic theory $\\kappa$ is identically zero for monatomic gases at low density\n",

    " * For Newtonian fluids there are no time derivatives (i.e. a stationary solution)\n",
    " * Pure rotation produces no viscous forces\n",
    " * The dilational viscosity $\\kappa$ is zero for monatomic gases, and $(\\boldsymbol{\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}) = 0$ for incompressible fluids, and it can be ignored except for describing the fluid dynamics of bubbles in liquid or sound adsorption in polyatomic gases\n",

    "## Tube vs Submerged Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As described previously, fluid flow through complex porous structures is usually examined with simple models based on either tubes or submerged objects. The treatment of these models is completely different for two main reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, even though the flow is laminar in both the tube and the submerged objects, there are differences in the way viscous forces effect internal and external flows. An internal flow is constrained by the bounding walls and viscous effects will grow from the sidewalls and eventually meet downstream, permeating the entire flow. External flows are unconfined, free to expand no matter how thick the viscous boundary layers become. Clearly this distinction is critical when there is only one object, but diminishes in importance as the number of objects increases and they are packed closer together, eventually reaching the point where the two flow schemes become equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, fluid flow fields are complex and analytical relations are only possible when the geometry and flow field is simplified so the streamlines are straight, and the velocity distribution is only dependent on a single variable (e.g. a tube with constant pressure drop), so that ordinary differential equations can be used. The derivation presented below produces results attributed to G.Hagen (1839) and J.L. Poiseuille (1941).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the flow is around a submerged object, the streamlines will bend and the velocity distribution is based on more than one independent variable, so partial differential equations are required. The simplest possible flow condition is based on creeping flow (i.e. completely laminar with no separation, known as Stokes flow), the simplest geometry is a sphere and the derivation produces results attributed to G.G. Stokes (1851).\n",

These differences will become more obvious when the friction factors of the sphere and tube are analysed.\n",

    "With the differences established, of particular note is the regime where the external flow and internal flow solutions become equivalent (i.e. once the submerged objects are packed tightly together).

    "### Definition of Absolute Permeability\n",
    "A porous structure consists of voids (pore space) interspersed with some solid phase (particles, struts etc.), contained within some volume, which is termed the bed. Assuming the voids are connected, then the fluid flow rate is $q (m^3  s^-1)$ and the bed cross-sectional area is $A (m^2)$. Thus the *superficial velocity* (empty tube velocity) $U_0$ is the total flow rate divided by the cross-sectional area (see Figure 2.8 a. below).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_0 = \\frac{q}{A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of solid phase in the bed will reduce the area available for fluid flow, and hence the *interstitial velocity*, between all of the solid phase shapes, is much higher then the superficial velocity.

    "\n",
    "If there was no solid phase in the bed, then the interstitial and superficial velocities would be the same, if the bed was 100% filled with solid, the resistance to flow would be infinite. The resistance to fluid flow produced by the solid phase gives rise to a pressure drop in the fluid $(\\Delta P)$. Pressure is not a vector quantity, but a (decreasing) pressure gradient in the direction of flow is $(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L})$. However, it can also be considered as a pressure difference, which is a scalar quantity.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "The previous analysis, using the Jack Dvorkin (cite) approach with different Fontainbleau data, proves that simple tube models can precisely model the behaviour of real porous granular materials such as sandstone, by extension with additional concepts (tortuosity, relating tortuosity to porosity, and percolation porosity). Further, by using a simple analogy comparing the surface area of random packed spheres against the surface area of the tubes, a \"grain-size\" model can be developed, which is surprisingly effective (see Fig 2.14).\n",
    "\n",
    "How can wriggly tubes represent the permeability behaviour of porous granular material? The previous derivations of tube and sphere flow demonstrates their flow behaviour is completely different. How can one represent the other? When are they similar, how close together do the particles have to be before this tube analogy can be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, as spheres become closer and closer, the differences between flow between them and flow down a tube disappear, or appear to. Another view on this fascinating phenomenon is provided in the next Section on Friction factors, where tubes, spheres and packed bed are compared"

    "## Friction Factors\n",
    "Many engineering problems fall into two broad categories, flow in channels or tubes and flow over submerged objects. In tube flow the objective is to find the relationship between the volumetric flow and the pressure drop, in submerged flow the objective is to find the relationship between the velocity of the approaching flow and the drag force on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For many systems the velocity and pressure profiles cannot be calculated due to complicated geometry or turbulent flow (e.g. packed bed). These systems can be modelled by combining selected experimental data with representative dimensionless variables to construct correlations that describe the flow in geometrically similar systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of Friction Factor\n",
    "Consider the steadily driven flow of a fluid of constant density in one of two types of systems:\n",
    " 1. the fluid flows in a straight conduit of uniform cross section\n",
    " 2. the fluid flows around objects that have two planes of symmetry parallel to the direction of flow\n",
    " \n",
    "There will be a force $ \\boldsymbol{F} _{f \\leftarrow s} $ exerted by the fluid on the solid surfaces. This force can then be split into two parts, $ \\boldsymbol{F} _s $ the force that would be exerted by the fluid if it was stationary, and $ \\boldsymbol{F} _k $ the additional force associated with the fluid motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In systems of type 1, $\\boldsymbol{F} _k $ points in the direction of the average velocity $(v)$ in the tube or conduit, in systems of type 2, $ \\boldsymbol{F} _k $ points in the direction of the approach velocity $\\boldsymbol{v} _\\infty $. For both systems, the assumption is that the magnitude of the force $ \\boldsymbol{F} _k $ is proportional to a characteristic area $A$ and a characteristic kinetic energy $K$ per unit volume, thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_k = AK \\mathit{f}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "in which the proportionality constant $\\mathit{f}$ is called the *friction factor*, a definition rather than a low of fluid mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note: It will be shown later that this assumption is a very limited approximation for type 2, as it handwaves differences in shape away into variations in kinetic energy or the friction factor, and that the projected area is insufficient by itself to define overall flow resistance of any shape, and it is only reasonable for certain shapes*\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns out to be a useful definition, because the dimensionless friction factor $\\mathit{f}$ can be given as a relatively simple function of the Reynolds number and system shape. However, for any given flow system, $\\mathit{f}$ is not defined until $A$ and $K$ are specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type 1 - Flow in Tubes or Conduits\n",
    "For flow in tubes or conduits, $A$ is usually taken to be the wetted surface, and $K$ is taken to be $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho \\langle v \\rangle ^2$. Specifically for circular tubes of radius $R$ and length $L$, the friction factor $\\mathit{f}$ is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_k = (2 \\pi RL)(\\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho \\langle v \\rangle ^2)\\mathit{f}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the quantity measured is not $F_k$, but the pressure difference $p_0 - p_L$, and the elevation difference $h_0 - h_1$. A force balance between $0$ and $L$ in the direction of flow for fully developed flow gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_k = [(p_0 - p_L) = \\rho g(h_0 - h_L)]\\pi R^2 = (\\mathscr{P}_o -\\mathscr{P}_L)\\pi R^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Eliminating $F_k$ between the last two equations gives the Fanning friction factor\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathit{f} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left ( \\frac{D}{L} \\right ) \\left ( \\frac{\\mathscr{P}_o -\\mathscr{P}_L}{\\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho \\langle v \\rangle ^2} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going through the derivation, and considering fully developed flow (i.e. long tubes), the friction factor can be considered as a function of the Reynolds number\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathit{f} = f(Re)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $\\mathit{f}$ can be determined experimentally from Eqn. X and plotted on a friction factor chart according to Eqn. Y. The laminar part of the friction factor curve is a plot of the Hagen-Poiseuille relationship, which can be shown by combining Eqn. 27 with Eqn. 99 above."

    "\n",
    "Friction factor correlations based on empirical measurements are available for a wide variety of situations, including flow across cylinders, tube banks, baffles and many other situations. A very common problem, of relevance to this discussion, is the flow through a packed bed or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of friction factor models have been extensively tried, but the tube model has proved to be the most effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of materials can be used for the packing in the column: spheres, cylinders, Beryl saddles and so on. The key assumption is that the packing is statistically uniform, so there is no channeling (in actual practice, channeling frequently occurs), and that it is small in comparison to the column or bed diameter.\n",

    "## Rationale for Minimum Dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to unify the different shape and layout paradigms a series of bounds are needed to reduce the set of alternatives, from infinite down to a solvable number of variations. Further, these bounds must form the foundation around which a classification and configuration scheme can then be established. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inital bounds are defined by the rather extreme design constraints, chosen to throw the performance impact of shape into high relief:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Stokes Flow Regime: The overall system velocity $ (U _0 = 1 m/s) $ produces laminar flow\n",
    " - Tiny Pressure Drop: The velocity is driven by $ \\Delta P = 10 kPa $, over system length of $L = 500 mm$\n",
    " - Fast Diffusion Speed: The diffusion time is $ 1/10^{th} $ of the residence time $(t _{diff} = \\frac {t _{res}}{10} $\n",
    " - Fast Thermal Swing: Swing of $t _{swing} = 5 secs $ between minimum $(T _1 = 308 K)$ and maximum $(T _2 = 368 K)$ (NB. This bound is not considered in this section)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these constraints alone are insufficient to reduce the potential number of different shapes, and some additional rules must be set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a terminal scale, where adsorption takes place, or a shape dimension based on manufacturing or economic limits is common one. Each of the previous studies have been based on some fixed micro-scale, usually based on some rationale or limitation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The open question lies in the choice of rationale for this minimum dimension. It is obviously advantageous for the designer if it is based on some performance criteria, rather than based on manufacturing constraints, or conventional practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, what is the best way of defining the minimum size of any shape for the system under study?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pressure-Driven Flows Have No Minimum Velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown previously, the simplest way to consider the inside of the system is to model it as a tube, using the Hagen Poisueille Law (recalling Eqn. 27), which shows that the relation between the volumetric flow rate $q _1$, of a fluid with viscosity $\\mu$ driven by a pressure drop $\\Delta P$, through a tube of radius $r _1$ and length $L _1$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q _1 = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot \\pi \\cdot r _1 ^4}{8 \\cdot \\mu _a \\cdot L _1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that volumetric flow $q _1$, is proportional to the $4^{th}$ power of the tube radius $r _1$. Given that the pressure drop constraint is known on a per metre basis as a System-Wide Constraint, then eqn. (1) can be applied in place of the actual tube length and pressure drop. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$q _1 = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot \\pi \\cdot r _1 ^4}{8 \\cdot \\mu _a} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right) _{constraint} $$\n",
    "\n",

    "Figure 2.2 demonstrates that the system pressure drop can drive convective flow at the Overall System Velocity of 1 m/s down a tube of suprisingly small radius, $r _0 = 85.93 \\mu m$, which is a candidate for the smallest dimension of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second conclusion that can be drawn from Fig. 2.2 is that a pressure drop will force convective flow down even the smallest tube. At first glance this observation seems unimportant, since the size of the tube that produces the average system velocity is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, an average system velocity, implies zones of lower and higher velocities that add up to the desired average, and this concept applies at every scale (e.g. micro, meso, macro). Thus, combining both larger and smaller tubes at various scales to produce the overall system velocity still remains interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Radial Peclet Number - Biological Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Some classes of porous structures are inspired by biological branching flow schemes (e.g. arteries and veins), and are proposed to offer advantages (lower pressure drop for a given volumetric flow than straight tubes). In this scheme, the branching serves to both split the flows so they can be distributed to irrigate the volume, and slow the flows at the terminal tubes (e.g. capillaries) so adsorption can occur preferentially, before the spent flows are regathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The radial Peclet Number $(Pe _r)$ is a non-dimensional number providing the ratio of convective transport to the diffusive transport from the centreline to the wall through distance $r _1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Pe _r = \\frac{v _1 \\cdot r _1}{D _m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Popularised by Bejan (**cite**), the rationale is that when the radial Peclet Number is equal to 1, $(Pe _r = 1)$, then fluid \"packets\" from the centreline have diffused to the wall and therefore the full adsorptive value of the flow stream has been utilised. In short, the residence time of the fluid in the tube is equal to the diffusive time from the centreline to the wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v_{1Pe_r} = \\frac {D_m}{r _1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axial Peclet Number - Smallest Relevant Tube\n",
    "Another approach is to consider the axial Peclet Number $(Pe _a)$, which is the ratio of the convective and diffusive velocities along the length of the tube. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Pe_a = \\frac {v _1 \\cdot L _1}{D_m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the micro tube under study is somewhere in the midst of the system, its length $(L _1)$ is unkown. However, in some systems, the length of the tube is related to an integer number of diameters, for example in the lung this ratio is uniformly N=3 across all sizes of tubes (cite), whereas in engineering a hydrodynamic entrance length of N=10 is assumed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing this length to diameter ratio $(N)$, and making the assumption that the smallest tube of interest to the convective flow designer, is the one where the convective velocity is equal to the diffusive velocity (ie. $Pe = 1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v_{1Pe_a} = \\frac {D_m}{2 \\cdot N \\cdot r _1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale for this concept is that there is no point the convective designer building anything smaller, as diffusion will be faster than pressure-driven flows, so is a true minimum. For comparison purposes, two different size ratios are chosen to highlight the differences between short, fast, fat tubes (N=3), and long, slow, skinny tubes (N=100). The molecular diffusion of methane is taken as $D_m = 1.02 \\cdot 10^{-5} m^2/s$\n",

    "The basics of fluid mechanics can be outlined simply, Newtons Law of Viscosity shows that:\n",
    " - Pressure forces always act perpendicular to exposed surfaces\n",
    " - Viscous forces come into play when there are velocity gradients, and they act at some angle to the surface\n",
    " \n",
    "When it comes to shape, then fluid is modelled as either flowing between constraints (tube, channel etc.), or around constraints (submerged objects), and their treatment and resulting behaviour are markedly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, the review above proved that when real, submerged objects are packed very close together (e.g. Fontainbleau sandstone), then they can be modelled very effectively by extremely simple tube models if one introduces some additional elaborations to the design (e.g. tortuosity, relationship between permeability and porosity, percolation porosity etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, these simple models are generalised through non-dimensionalisation and fitting against experimental data to develop powerful correlations for many flow shapes, that are proven by years of usage to be sufficiently descriptive as to serve as a reliable base for process design. Even in this field, the efficacy of the tube model over the submerged model can be observed through the modelling of packed beds of particles by the Blake Kozeny, Blake Plummer and Ergun equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the current models backed by ~300 years of research can explain every porous shape they have encountered, so where is the gap? How can all of the above be true, and yet be shown to be a poor approximation in certain situations? And even if it could be, how could this be leveraged for advantage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Underlying this impressive edifice is a series of key assumptions, such as the viscous forces impacting a fluid flowing through a packed bed are dependent (solely) on the volume divided by the surface area (e.g. modified Reynolds Number), or the viscous drag of a submerged object is due to its projected area perpendicular to the direction of flow (Stokes solution for creeping flow around a sphere). What if these are only weak approximations and under the hood it looks rather different?\n"

    "# A New Rationale for Shape and Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "The background literature demonstrates no clear guidelines on shape, other than tubes are more efficient (less friction), than submerged shapes. Tubes are also capable of modelling any real porous structure. In terms of a minimum dimension for a shape, there are a number of functional arguments that may define a minimum, with no clear functional advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally a new rationale behind the shape and layout of systems needs more than a single assumption that can be invalidated, and it in fact needs a sequence of different insights at different scales that resonate together in such a way as to create a linear emergence, or a whole better way. However, it is also obvious that one needs some bottom level on which to base this stack, and it needs to be experimentally compared to the current alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since previous studies had only examined experimentally at best some ten's of different shapes, realistically to find new insights an investigation would expect to examine hundred's of different models. In fact, this thesis is inspired by direct observation of more than 1,500 optimisation loops (i.e. watching the flow pattern in every realisation, inside an optimisation loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "This section begins with evidence that disproves key assumptions made on the nature of flow in the previous derivations. Then the implications of these findings are outlined. These observations are then used to frame a new understanding of the ideal micro-scale flow scheme. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Evidence that Demands a Verdict\n",
    "At present, the well-validated assertion is that permeability is proportional to surface area and porosity, and/or that viscous forces are proportional to surface area.\n",

    "Consider then, two sets of results comparing shapes (rectangular array of unit shapes) with the same surface area and aspect ratio with only a difference in configuration (i.e. offset or parallel array) between them. Each has the same length and only the width/height is optimised to attain the average velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If viscous forces were only proportional to surface area, then the widths should have been the same, instead they were widely different. Why?\n",

    "The immediate conclusion that can be drawn by examining the images in Fig 2.X above, is the difference in colour between A & B, and C & D, specifically the amount of red. Red is the colour that represents maximum velocity.\n",

    "Thus, observationally it is clear that almost all of the available channel space is filled with red (i.e. maximum velocity) in B & D, whereas in A & C, the red is concentrated in small spots, with a lot of blue (low velocity) areas. In essence, for B & D the shape is such that the flow can utilise almost all of the available space for maximum velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second observation is that the range of velocity's (i.e. difference between maximum and minimum) is much smaller for B & D, than for C & D. Recalling Newtons Law of Viscosity (Eqn. 3), where the viscous forces are the linear sum of the velocity gradients, the implication being that the viscous forces are lower overall and more evenly distributed over the flow space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then it is clear that shape configuration is a major determinant of viscous forces, independently of dimensions, as certain configurations enable these viscous forces to be spread over the entire channel, while others concentrate the forces in small areas, leading to higher forces.\n",

The rule defined above leads to the inescapable conclusion that ideal flow is fully constrained by walls (i.e. tubes, laminates, channels etc.), and that any reduction in constraint continuity (i.e. gaps) must lead to a reduction in flow efficiency (i.e. areas where the velocity gradient is reduced).\n",

The archetypal result of this type of investigation is that ideal structures will perform best if the manufacturing tolerances could be made smaller (manufacturing limitation), but until then the stochastic works pretty good, given sufficient energy (pressure drop).\n",
    "\n",
    "These results raise questions:\n",
    "  - ideal flow can have its benefits, particularly as it enables tighter packing (i.e. constraining walls are closest when flow is ideal), but at what level of inefficiency do the benefits fade?\n",
    "  - a certain amount of less than ideal flow is clearly no barrier to overall system productivity, but how do flow inefficiencies at various scales, impact system functional efficiency, what types of flow inefficiencies and scale combinations are desirable, tolerable, or undesirable?\n",

One that takes advantage of the previous observations, and uses new metrics to characterise the differences at all scales.\n",

    "Over the last few hundred years there has been considerable investigation into biological design rules, particularly those amenable to analytical solutions (e.g. tubes such as arteries, veins, bronchial, urethra etc.). The investigations have often focused on the transition from convection to diffusion, and the conditions or dimensions where this occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, biological systems are designed so that the final exchange between convection and diffusion occurs at some terminal location, when the downstream convective speed is equivalent to the axial diffusive velocity (i.e. Pe=1). In this scheme, the branched, biological tube networks that lead to this terminal exchange point, serve to both split the flows, and slow the flows. Thus there has been considerable interest in their design.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pro's to Biological Design\n",
    "Murray's Law is based on the principle of minimum work and for convective flows it equates the cube of a tube's diameter to the sum of the cube of all the child tubes (i.e. volumetric continuity), where simplistically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_0^3 = d_{1a}^3 + d_{1b}^3 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, different biological tube networks have subtle variations amongst them depending on the underlying functional objective being optimised, and so the more general approach to representing the relationship is to assume the child tube diameters are identical and introduce a branching parameter (X).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X = \\frac{d_0^3}{2d_1^3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the nature of the tube network, and the resulting changes in physical properties is totally dependent on the choice of $X$. If:\n",
    " - X < 0.5: Each diameter will increase on successive branches\n",
    " - X = 0.5: Each diameter will be constant on successive branches, the wall shear stress and resistance both reduce if  $X < 1$\n",
    " - X = 1: Each diameter will reduce by $2^{\\frac{1}{3}}$, the principle of minimum work and volumetric continuity apply, the wall shear stress and resistance are constant\n",
    " - X > $\\sqrt{2}$: The average velocity will increase with successive branches, wall shear stress and resistance both increases if $X > 1$ \n",

    "Thus, Murray's Law enables tube networks to be designed to express different functional requirements, and has been researched extensively for this purpose. There is no doubt that a shape based on Murray's Law has a very powerful functional argument, and thereby this archetype must be compared experimentally.\n",

    "#### Con's to Biological Design\n",
    "While biological design is attractive for many functional reasons, there are issues, particularly with regard to the system design examined in this paper. These issues lie in some of the objective functions for the design, and the match to overall system morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the argument that exchange between convection and diffusion best occurs at some terminal stage seems undesirable in a rectangular adsorption layer (i.e. plate and frame model), where ideally adsorption occurs evenly throughout the system. Second the argument that this exchange step should occur at some best convective velocity (i.e. Pe=1), seems important for biological systems, but less so for industrial systems. Further, the argument that the aspect ratio of tubes should be related to the axial diffusion speed, in order to ensure maximum utilisation of each fluid packet (i.e. Bejan et al.), does not appear to match established industrial practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regard to the overall system morphology that is derived from the rules, bifurcation is not generally useful industrially, and instead multiple branching tubes are used. There are some advantages, for example clear inlet and outlet tubes that could be matched to manifolds, but it is anticipated that there will be too much wasted volume, due to inevitable mismatching of section thicknesses of a branched model. Ideally, for an adsorption system, every molecule has exactly the same residence time while in the system, and constant section thickness makes this easier to achieve.\n",
